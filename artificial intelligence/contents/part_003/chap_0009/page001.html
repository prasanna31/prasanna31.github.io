        <h2>1. Introduction to Problem Solving by Search</h2>
        <p>
            One of the fundamental capabilities of an intelligent agent is the ability to
            <strong>solve problems</strong>. In Artificial Intelligence, problem solving is often
            modeled as a process of searching through a space of possible states to find a sequence
            of actions that leads from an initial situation to a desired goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            This approach is known as <strong>problem solving by search</strong>. Before an agent
            can apply any search algorithm, it must first precisely understand and represent the
            problem it is trying to solve. This is achieved through <em>problem formulation</em>
            and <em>problem definition</em>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Problem Formulation</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Problem formulation</strong> is the process of deciding how to represent a
            real-world problem in a way that an AI agent can reason about and solve using search
            techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
            The real world is complex and continuous, but search algorithms operate on well-defined,
            abstract models. Problem formulation bridges this gap by selecting the relevant aspects
            of the world and ignoring unnecessary details.
        </p>

        <h3>2.1 Purpose of Problem Formulation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To convert an informal problem into a formal structure</li>
            <li>To define what states and actions are relevant</li>
            <li>To make the problem solvable using search algorithms</li>
            <li>To balance realism and computational feasibility</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Important Insight:</strong>  
            A poorly formulated problem can be extremely hard or impossible to solve, even if a
            solution exists.
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Problem Definition</h2>
        <p>
            Once the problem is formulated conceptually, it is expressed formally as a
            <strong>problem definition</strong>. A problem definition specifies the exact components
            required by a search algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
            In classical AI, a problem is defined by the following five elements.
        </p>

        <h3>3.1 Initial State</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>initial state</strong> describes the starting point of the agent in the
            state space.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Represents the current situation</li>
            <li>Must be fully specified</li>
            <li>Acts as the root node of the search tree</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 State Space</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>state space</strong> is the set of all possible states that can be reached
            from the initial state by applying actions.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>May be finite or infinite</li>
            <li>Defines the search domain</li>
            <li>Graphically represented as a graph or tree</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3 Actions (Successor Function)</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>successor function</strong> defines the available actions for each state and
            the resulting states after performing those actions.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maps a state to possible next states</li>
            <li>Defines the edges of the state space graph</li>
            <li>Determines how the agent can move through the space</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.4 Goal Test</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>goal test</strong> determines whether a given state satisfies the objective
            of the problem.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Used to detect successful states</li>
            <li>May check a single goal or multiple goals</li>
            <li>Ends the search when satisfied</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.5 Path Cost</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>path cost</strong> assigns a numeric cost to a sequence of actions.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Measures solution quality</li>
            <li>May represent time, distance, energy, or risk</li>
            <li>Used to find optimal solutions</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Example: Route Finding Problem</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Initial State:</strong> Starting city (e.g., Arad)</p>
            <p><strong>State Space:</strong> All cities and road connections</p>
            <p><strong>Actions:</strong> Drive to a neighboring city</p>
            <p><strong>Goal Test:</strong> Reach destination city (e.g., Bucharest)</p>
            <p><strong>Path Cost:</strong> Total distance traveled</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Once defined this way, standard search algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Uniform Cost Search,
            or A* can be applied.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Relationship Between Formulation and Definition</h2>
        <p>
            Problem formulation is a conceptual and modeling step, while problem definition is a
            precise and formal specification.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Formulation decides <em>what</em> to model</li>
            <li>Definition specifies <em>how</em> it is represented</li>
            <li>Both strongly influence search efficiency</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Problem solving by search relies on accurately representing problems in a structured
            manner. Problem formulation abstracts the real world into a solvable model, while
            problem definition provides the exact components required by search algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
            A well-defined problem is the foundation upon which all search strategies operate.
