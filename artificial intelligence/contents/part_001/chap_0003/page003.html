        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cognitive Science are deeply interconnected fields that
            aim to understand intelligence. While AI focuses on building intelligent systems,
            Cognitive Science seeks to explain how the human mind works. Together, they form a
            feedback loop where theories of human cognition inspire AI models, and AI systems
            help test and refine theories about the mind.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What Is Cognitive Science?</h2>
        <p>
            Cognitive Science is an interdisciplinary field that studies the mind and intelligence.
            It draws knowledge from multiple disciplines:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Psychology</strong> – mental processes such as perception, memory, and learning</li>
            <li><strong>Neuroscience</strong> – the biological basis of cognition</li>
            <li><strong>Linguistics</strong> – language and meaning</li>
            <li><strong>Philosophy</strong> – consciousness, reasoning, and knowledge</li>
            <li><strong>Computer Science & AI</strong> – computational models of cognition</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The central question of cognitive science is:
            <em>How does the mind acquire, represent, and use knowledge?</em>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>AI as a Model of Human Cognition</h2>
        <p>
            One of the original motivations behind AI was to model human thinking.
            Early AI researchers believed that by replicating reasoning processes
            in machines, we could better understand how humans think.
        </p>

        <h3>Symbolic AI and Human Reasoning</h3>
        <p>
            Symbolic AI models intelligence as rule-based manipulation of symbols,
            similar to logical reasoning in humans. This approach aligns with the
            idea that human cognition operates like a formal system of rules.
        </p>

        <h3>Connectionist Models and the Brain</h3>
        <p>
            Neural networks are inspired by the structure of the human brain.
            Although artificial neurons are simplified, they capture the idea
            that cognition emerges from interconnected processing units.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Perception and Pattern Recognition</h2>
        <p>
            Cognitive science studies how humans perceive the world through vision,
            hearing, and touch. AI mirrors this through technologies such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Computer Vision (image and object recognition)</li>
            <li>Speech Recognition</li>
            <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These AI systems attempt to computationally model how the brain extracts
            meaningful patterns from raw sensory input.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Learning and Memory</h2>
        <p>
            Human learning involves forming mental representations, strengthening
            connections, and adapting behavior. Cognitive science explains learning
            through theories such as conditioning and memory consolidation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Machine learning parallels this process by adjusting parameters based
            on experience (data). However, unlike humans, AI lacks episodic memory,
            emotions, and contextual understanding.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Language, Thought, and Meaning</h2>
        <p>
            Language is a key topic in cognitive science because it reflects how
            humans structure thought. AI systems process language syntactically
            and statistically, but they do not possess semantic understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
            This raises philosophical questions: Does manipulating symbols
            constitute understanding? This debate is famously highlighted
            by the Chinese Room Argument.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Consciousness and the Limits of AI</h2>
        <p>
            Cognitive science investigates consciousness, self-awareness, and
            subjective experience. AI, however, operates without awareness or
            intentionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            While AI can simulate intelligent behavior, it does not experience
            thoughts or emotions. This distinction remains a fundamental boundary
            between artificial systems and human cognition.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Mutual Influence of AI and Cognitive Science</h2>
        <p>
            AI and cognitive science influence each other in powerful ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>AI provides computational models to test cognitive theories</li>
            <li>Cognitive science inspires more human-like AI systems</li>
            <li>Failures in AI reveal gaps in our understanding of intelligence</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This collaboration continues to shape modern research in both fields.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            AI and Cognitive Science together offer a deeper understanding of
            intelligence—from machines that act intelligently to humans who
            genuinely understand. While AI excels at specific tasks, cognitive
            science reminds us that human intelligence is deeply embodied,
            conscious, and contextual. The partnership between these fields
            is essential for advancing both technology and our understanding
            of the human mind.
