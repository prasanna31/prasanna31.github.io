        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable success in areas such as image recognition,
            natural language processing, and game playing. However, despite its rapid progress,
            AI has significant limitations. Recognizing these limits helps prevent overreliance
            and unrealistic expectations.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Lack of Common Sense</h2>
        <p class="limit">Limitation:</p>
        <p class="explanation">
            AI systems lack true common-sense reasoning that humans naturally possess.
        </p>
        <p>
            While humans can easily understand everyday situations, AI struggles with simple
            real-world reasoning unless explicitly trained on massive datasets. AI does not
            inherently understand cause, effect, or physical intuition.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Dependence on Data</h2>
        <p class="limit">Limitation:</p>
        <p class="explanation">
            AI systems are only as good as the data they are trained on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Poor-quality, incomplete, or biased data leads to unreliable and unfair outcomes.
            Unlike humans, AI cannot reason effectively beyond the scope of its training data.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Lack of True Understanding</h2>
        <p class="limit">Limitation:</p>
        <p class="explanation">
            AI does not genuinely understand meaning or intent.
        </p>
        <p>
            AI models manipulate symbols and patterns mathematically. Even advanced language models
            do not comprehend content the way humans do; they generate responses based on statistical
            correlations, not awareness or intent.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Inability to Generalize Like Humans</h2>
        <p class="limit">Limitation:</p>
        <p class="explanation">
            AI struggles with transferring knowledge across unrelated domains.
        </p>
        <p>
            Humans can apply knowledge learned in one context to solve problems in entirely new
            situations. Most AI systems are narrow and fail when operating outside their
            predefined task domain.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Ethical and Moral Reasoning</h2>
        <p class="limit">Limitation:</p>
        <p class="explanation">
            AI cannot make moral or ethical judgments on its own.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ethical decision-making requires values, emotions, and social understanding.
            AI can only follow rules encoded by humans and lacks moral accountability.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Explainability and Transparency</h2>
        <p class="limit">Limitation:</p>
        <p class="explanation">
            Many AI models operate as "black boxes".
        </p>
        <p>
            Deep learning models often produce accurate results without providing clear explanations
            for their decisions. This lack of transparency is problematic in critical domains
            such as healthcare, law, and finance.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Creativity and Original Thought</h2>
        <p class="limit">Limitation:</p>
        <p class="explanation">
            AI does not create truly original ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
            AI-generated content is based on recombining existing patterns found in data.
            While outputs may appear creative, they lack intentional originality and purpose.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence is a powerful computational tool, but it is not a replacement
            for human intelligence. Its limitations highlight the importance of human oversight,
            ethical responsibility, and realistic expectations. Understanding these limits ensures
            that AI is used as an assistant rather than a decision-maker.
