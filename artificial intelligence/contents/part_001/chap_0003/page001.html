    <h1>AI Myths and Misconceptions</h1>
    <p>Separating hype, fear, and fiction from reality</p>
</header>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is often surrounded by exaggerated claims, unrealistic fears,
            and misleading portrayals in movies and media. These myths create confusion about what AI
            can and cannot do. Understanding the reality behind these misconceptions is essential for
            using AI responsibly and effectively.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Myth 1: AI Is the Same as Human Intelligence</h2>
        <p class="myth">Myth:</p>
        <p>
            AI systems think, reason, and understand the world exactly like humans.
        </p>
        <p class="reality">Reality:</p>
        <p>
            AI does not possess human-like understanding or consciousness. Most AI systems are
            narrow and task-specific. They operate by recognizing patterns in data, not by genuine
            reasoning or awareness.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Myth 2: AI Will Replace All Human Jobs</h2>
        <p class="myth">Myth:</p>
        <p>
            AI will lead to mass unemployment by replacing humans in every profession.
        </p>
        <p class="reality">Reality:</p>
        <p>
            While AI automates certain tasks, it also creates new roles and augments human capabilities.
            Jobs evolve rather than disappear entirely. Historically, technology has shifted work
            rather than eliminating it.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Myth 3: AI Is Always Objective and Unbiased</h2>
        <p class="myth">Myth:</p>
        <p>
            AI systems make perfectly fair and neutral decisions.
        </p>
        <p class="reality">Reality:</p>
        <p>
            AI systems learn from data, and if the data contains bias, the AI can amplify it.
            Bias in AI reflects societal biases present in training datasets, not independent judgment.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Myth 4: AI Systems Are Self-Aware</h2>
        <p class="myth">Myth:</p>
        <p>
            Modern AI systems have consciousness, emotions, or self-awareness.
        </p>
        <p class="reality">Reality:</p>
        <p>
            AI systems do not have feelings or self-awareness. They generate outputs based on
            mathematical models and probabilities, not subjective experiences.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Myth 5: AI Can Learn Without Human Involvement</h2>
        <p class="myth">Myth:</p>
        <p>
            AI learns entirely on its own without human guidance.
        </p>
        <p class="reality">Reality:</p>
        <p>
            Humans play a crucial role in designing models, selecting data, defining objectives,
            and evaluating results. Even self-learning systems rely heavily on human-defined rules
            and constraints.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            AI is a powerful tool, but it is neither magical nor dangerous by default. Dispelling
            myths helps set realistic expectations and promotes responsible development. Understanding
            AI’s limitations is just as important as appreciating its capabilities.
