        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience are closely related disciplines that
            seek to understand intelligence from different perspectives. Neuroscience
            investigates how biological brains perceive, learn, and make decisions,
            while AI aims to build computational systems that exhibit intelligent behavior.
            The interaction between these fields has driven major breakthroughs in modern AI.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Neuroscience: Understanding the Brain</h2>
        <p>
            Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system, with a primary
            focus on the brain. It examines how neurons communicate, how brain regions
            specialize, and how cognitive functions emerge from neural activity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Key elements studied in neuroscience include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Neurons and synapses</li>
            <li>Neural signaling and plasticity</li>
            <li>Brain structures and functional areas</li>
            <li>Learning, memory, and perception</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Biological Neurons vs Artificial Neurons</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial neural networks are inspired by biological neurons, but they
            are highly simplified abstractions.
        </p>

        <h3>Biological Neurons</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Transmit electrical and chemical signals</li>
            <li>Exhibit complex, nonlinear behavior</li>
            <li>Adapt through synaptic plasticity</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Artificial Neurons</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Compute weighted sums of inputs</li>
            <li>Use activation functions</li>
            <li>Learn via optimization algorithms</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Despite their simplicity, artificial neurons collectively enable powerful
            learning capabilities.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Learning and Plasticity</h2>
        <p>
            The human brain learns through synaptic plasticity—connections between neurons
            strengthen or weaken based on experience. This biological principle inspired
            learning rules in AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            In machine learning, training algorithms adjust model parameters to minimize
            error. While mathematically driven, this process echoes how biological systems
            adapt to stimuli over time.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Perception and Sensory Processing</h2>
        <p>
            Neuroscience shows that perception is hierarchical: early brain regions
            detect simple features, while later regions integrate them into complex
            representations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Deep learning architectures mimic this structure:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Early layers detect edges or patterns</li>
            <li>Middle layers extract shapes and textures</li>
            <li>Final layers identify objects or meanings</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Brain-Inspired AI Models</h2>
        <p>
            Several AI models are directly influenced by neuroscience:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</strong> – inspired by the visual cortex</li>
            <li><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</strong> – inspired by temporal neural activity</li>
            <li><strong>Spiking Neural Networks</strong> – model neuron firing behavior</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These models attempt to capture not just performance, but also
            biological plausibility.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Neuroscience Helping AI</h2>
        <p>
            Neuroscience provides insights that guide AI research, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Efficient learning with limited data</li>
            <li>Energy-efficient computation</li>
            <li>Robust and adaptive behavior</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Understanding the brain helps AI researchers design systems that are
            more flexible and resilient.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>AI Helping Neuroscience</h2>
        <p>
            AI is also a powerful tool for neuroscience research. Machine learning
            algorithms analyze brain imaging data, detect neural patterns, and
            model brain disorders.
        </p>
        <p>
            Applications include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Brain signal decoding</li>
            <li>Neuroimaging analysis</li>
            <li>Brain-computer interfaces</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Limits and Open Challenges</h2>
        <p>
            Despite inspiration from neuroscience, AI systems remain far from
            replicating biological intelligence. Key challenges include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lack of true consciousness</li>
            <li>Oversimplified neuron models</li>
            <li>Limited understanding of brain mechanisms</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            AI and Neuroscience form a mutually beneficial relationship. While AI draws
            inspiration from the brain, neuroscience benefits from AI’s analytical power.
            Together, they move us closer to understanding intelligence—both artificial
            and biological—while highlighting the profound complexity of the human brain.
