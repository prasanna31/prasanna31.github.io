    <h1>AI and Philosophy</h1>
    <p>Exploring intelligence, mind, and meaning beyond machines</p>
</header>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence is not only a technical field but also a deeply
            philosophical one. Questions about intelligence, consciousness, reasoning,
            and ethics have long been central to philosophy. AI brings these questions
            into practical focus by attempting to recreate aspects of human intelligence
            in machines.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Philosophical Foundations of AI</h2>
        <p>
            The philosophical roots of AI can be traced back to classical thinkers
            such as Aristotle, Descartes, and Leibniz. Logic, rationality, and symbolic
            reasoning form the basis of early AI systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea that thought could be formalized and mechanized led to the belief
            that machines might one day think like humans.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Nature of Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
            A core philosophical question is: <em>What does it mean to be intelligent?</em>
            AI challenges traditional definitions by exhibiting intelligent behavior
            without consciousness or understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
            This raises the distinction between:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Weak AI</strong> – systems that simulate intelligence</li>
            <li><strong>Strong AI</strong> – systems that genuinely possess intelligence</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Mind–Body Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Philosophy has long debated the relationship between mind and body.
            AI reframes this debate by asking whether the mind is essentially a
            computational process.
        </p>
        <p>
            If mental states are computations, then machines could, in principle,
            possess minds. If not, AI may always remain a simulation of thought
            rather than true thinking.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Turing Test</h2>
        <p>
            Alan Turing proposed the Turing Test as a practical criterion for machine
            intelligence. If a machine’s responses are indistinguishable from a human’s,
            it can be considered intelligent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Philosophically, the test shifts the focus from internal states to
            observable behavior, emphasizing functional intelligence over consciousness.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Chinese Room Argument</h2>
        <p>
            John Searle’s Chinese Room argument challenges the idea that symbol
            manipulation constitutes understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
            A system may produce correct outputs without knowing what the symbols mean,
            suggesting that AI lacks genuine understanding, regardless of performance.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Consciousness and Qualia</h2>
        <p>
            Consciousness involves subjective experience, often referred to as
            <em>qualia</em>. AI systems process information but do not experience it.
        </p>
        <p>
            This gap highlights the difference between simulating mental states
            and actually having them.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Ethics and Moral Responsibility</h2>
        <p>
            As AI systems make decisions affecting human lives, philosophical
            questions about responsibility and ethics arise.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can machines be morally responsible?</li>
            <li>Who is accountable for AI decisions?</li>
            <li>Should AI have rights?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Most philosophers argue that responsibility remains with humans,
            as AI lacks intentionality and moral agency.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Free Will and Determinism</h2>
        <p>
            AI operates deterministically or probabilistically, raising questions
            about free will. Comparing human decision-making with AI forces
            philosophers to reconsider whether human choices are fundamentally different.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Limits of Philosophical AI</h2>
        <p>
            Despite impressive advances, AI does not resolve philosophical problems
            about meaning, consciousness, or selfhood. Instead, it exposes how
            complex and unresolved these issues remain.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            AI and philosophy are inseparable. While AI provides practical demonstrations
            of intelligent behavior, philosophy reminds us that intelligence is more
            than computation. The dialogue between these fields deepens our understanding
            of both machines and ourselves.
