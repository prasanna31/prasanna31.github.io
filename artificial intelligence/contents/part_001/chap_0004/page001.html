    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Mathematics is the backbone of Artificial Intelligence. Every AI algorithm,
            from simple rule-based systems to deep neural networks, is grounded in
            mathematical principles. Understanding the relationship between AI and
            mathematics reveals why AI works, where it fails, and how it can be improved.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Linear Algebra: The Language of AI</h2>
        <p>
            Linear algebra provides the framework for representing data and transformations
            in AI systems. Vectors, matrices, and tensors are used to encode inputs,
            parameters, and outputs.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Feature vectors represent data points</li>
            <li>Matrix multiplication models neural connections</li>
            <li>Eigenvalues and eigenvectors appear in dimensionality reduction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Without linear algebra, modern machine learning would not be computationally feasible.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Calculus and Optimization</h2>
        <p>
            Calculus allows AI systems to learn. Training a model involves optimizing
            a loss function, which measures error.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gradient-based methods, such as gradient descent, rely on derivatives to
            determine how parameters should be updated to minimize error.
        </p>
        <p>
            Backpropagation in neural networks is a direct application of multivariable calculus.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Probability and Statistics</h2>
        <p>
            AI operates in uncertain environments. Probability theory provides a way
            to model uncertainty, make predictions, and reason under incomplete information.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Random variables and distributions</li>
            <li>Bayesian inference</li>
            <li>Statistical estimation and hypothesis testing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Statistical thinking helps AI generalize from data rather than memorize it.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Discrete Mathematics and Logic</h2>
        <p>
            Early AI systems relied heavily on logic and discrete mathematics.
            Propositional and predicate logic enabled symbolic reasoning and
            knowledge representation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Graph theory supports:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Search algorithms</li>
            <li>Planning and reasoning</li>
            <li>Neural network structures</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Optimization Theory</h2>
        <p>
            Optimization theory studies how to find the best solution among many.
            AI models often involve non-convex optimization problems with millions
            of parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Techniques include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Convex optimization</li>
            <li>Heuristic methods</li>
            <li>Evolutionary algorithms</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Information Theory</h2>
        <p>
            Information theory quantifies information, uncertainty, and entropy.
            It plays a key role in learning theory and neural networks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Concepts such as entropy and cross-entropy are used to define loss functions
            and evaluate model performance.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Geometry and Manifold Learning</h2>
        <p>
            High-dimensional data often lies on lower-dimensional manifolds.
            Geometry helps AI models understand the structure of data spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA rely on geometric intuition.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Mathematical Limits of AI</h2>
        <p>
            Mathematics also exposes AI’s limitations. Theorems in computability
            and complexity show that not all problems can be solved efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overfitting, instability, and lack of guarantees arise from mathematical constraints.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            AI is not magic—it is mathematics in action. A strong mathematical foundation
            enables deeper understanding, better models, and more reliable systems.
            As AI evolves, mathematics will remain its guiding framework.
