    <h1>AI and Economics</h1>
    <p>How artificial intelligence reshapes markets, labor, and decision-making</p>
</header>

<main>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Economics studies how individuals, firms, and governments allocate scarce
            resources. Artificial Intelligence introduces a powerful new factor into
            this process by enabling automated decision-making, prediction, and
            optimization at unprecedented scale.
        </p>
        <p>
            The interaction between AI and economics affects productivity, labor markets,
            income distribution, market structures, and policy design.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>AI as an Economic Tool</h2>
        <p>
            From an economic perspective, AI is a general-purpose technology, similar
            to electricity or the internet. It enhances efficiency across multiple sectors.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Demand forecasting and pricing</li>
            <li>Supply chain optimization</li>
            <li>Risk assessment and credit scoring</li>
            <li>Market prediction and analytics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By reducing information asymmetry and transaction costs, AI alters
            traditional economic assumptions.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>AI and Productivity Growth</h2>
        <p>
            AI increases productivity by automating routine tasks and augmenting
            human decision-making. Firms can produce more output with fewer inputs.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, productivity gains may be unevenly distributed, benefiting
            firms and individuals with access to data, infrastructure, and skills.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Impact on Labor Markets</h2>
        <p>
            One of the most debated economic impacts of AI is its effect on employment.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Automation replaces repetitive and predictable jobs</li>
            <li>New jobs emerge in AI development, maintenance, and governance</li>
            <li>Skill-biased technological change increases demand for high-skilled labor</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            AI tends to transform jobs rather than eliminate work entirely, but
            transition costs can be significant.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>AI, Wages, and Inequality</h2>
        <p>
            Economic theory suggests that technologies favoring capital over labor
            can increase income inequality. AI often complements skilled workers
            while substituting low-skilled labor.
        </p>
        <p>
            This can lead to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wage polarization</li>
            <li>Increased returns to data and intellectual property</li>
            <li>Concentration of economic power</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>AI and Market Structure</h2>
        <p>
            AI can reinforce monopolistic tendencies by favoring firms with access
            to large datasets and computational resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            Network effects and algorithmic advantages may reduce competition,
            raising concerns about market fairness and regulation.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Algorithmic Decision-Making</h2>
        <p>
            AI-driven algorithms increasingly make economic decisions such as
            pricing, lending, hiring, and advertising.
        </p>
        <p>
            While efficient, these systems raise concerns about:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Transparency</li>
            <li>Bias and discrimination</li>
            <li>Accountability</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>AI in Macroeconomics</h2>
        <p>
            At the macroeconomic level, AI assists governments and institutions in:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Economic forecasting</li>
            <li>Policy simulation</li>
            <li>Fraud detection and tax compliance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            However, overreliance on AI models can introduce systemic risks
            if models fail or reinforce incorrect assumptions.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Ethical and Policy Challenges</h2>
        <p>
            The economic impact of AI raises important policy questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How should displaced workers be supported?</li>
            <li>Should AI-driven monopolies be regulated?</li>
            <li>How can economic benefits be shared equitably?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Addressing these issues requires coordination between economists,
            technologists, and policymakers.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Limits of Economic Modeling with AI</h2>
        <p>
            While AI excels at prediction, economics also requires understanding
            human behavior, incentives, and institutions. AI models may fail
            under changing conditions or unforeseen events.
        </p>
        <p>
            Economic reasoning and human judgment remain essential.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            AI is reshaping economics at every level—from individual decision-making
            to global markets. While it offers enormous efficiency gains, it also
            challenges existing economic structures and policies. Understanding
            AI’s economic implications is crucial for building inclusive and
            sustainable growth in the age of intelligent machines.
