<h1>Acting Rationally vs Thinking Rationally</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
In Artificial Intelligence, intelligence can be defined
not only by human likeness,
but also by rationality.
Two influential perspectives are
<strong>thinking rationally</strong> and <strong>acting rationally</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Both approaches are grounded in logic and decision theory,
yet they differ in what they consider the essence of intelligence.
</p>

<h2>Thinking Rationally</h2>

<div class="section">
<p>
The <strong>thinking rationally</strong> approach defines intelligence
as the ability to reason correctly according to formal rules of logic.
An intelligent system is one that arrives at logically valid conclusions.
</p>

<h3>Laws of Thought</h3>
<p>
This approach is often associated with the “laws of thought,”
which are formal logical principles that govern correct reasoning.
</p>

<h3>Characteristics of Thinking Rationally</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Uses formal logic and symbolic reasoning</li>
    <li>Emphasizes correctness of inference</li>
    <li>Focuses on internal reasoning processes</li>
    <li>Assumes complete and consistent knowledge</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the reasoning process follows logical rules,
the system is considered intelligent,
regardless of how practical or efficient it is.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Examples of Thinking Rationally</h3>

<div class="example">
<ul>
    <li>Automated theorem provers</li>
    <li>Logic-based expert systems</li>
    <li>Mathematical proof assistants</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Acting Rationally</h2>

<div class="section">
<p>
The <strong>acting rationally</strong> approach defines intelligence
as the ability to take actions that maximize the achievement of goals,
given the available information and constraints.
</p>

<h3>Rational Agents</h3>
<p>
This perspective is centered on the concept of a rational agent.
A rational agent chooses actions
that are expected to produce the best outcome.
</p>

<h3>Characteristics of Acting Rationally</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Focuses on outcomes and performance</li>
    <li>Handles uncertainty and incomplete information</li>
    <li>Uses probability and decision theory</li>
    <li>Emphasizes behavior over internal reasoning</li>
</ul>

<p>
Rationality here is defined by success,
not by adherence to perfect logical reasoning.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Examples of Acting Rationally</h3>

<div class="example">
<ul>
    <li>Autonomous robots navigating uncertain environments</li>
    <li>Game-playing agents optimizing win probability</li>
    <li>Recommendation systems maximizing user satisfaction</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Thinking Rationally vs Acting Rationally</h2>

<div class="comparison">
<ul>
    <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Correct reasoning vs effective action</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Logical validity vs goal achievement</li>
    <li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Often assumes completeness vs handles uncertainty</li>
    <li><strong>Practicality:</strong> Theoretically sound but impractical vs pragmatic and scalable</li>
    <li><strong>Domain:</strong> Logic and philosophy vs AI systems and agents</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Why Acting Rationally Dominates Modern AI</h2>

<div class="section">
<p>
Real-world environments are complex, uncertain, and dynamic.
Perfect logical reasoning is often impossible.
</p>

<p>
As a result, modern AI systems prioritize acting rationally,
making the best possible decisions
with limited time, data, and computational resources.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>

<div class="section">
<h3>Strengths of Thinking Rationally</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Provides strong theoretical foundations</li>
    <li>Ensures logically correct conclusions</li>
    <li>Highly interpretable reasoning</li>
</ul>

<h3>Limitations of Thinking Rationally</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Assumes perfect information</li>
    <li>Computationally expensive</li>
    <li>Struggles with real-world uncertainty</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h3>Strengths of Acting Rationally</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Practical and scalable</li>
    <li>Robust to uncertainty and noise</li>
    <li>Aligned with real-world success metrics</li>
</ul>

<h3>Limitations of Acting Rationally</h3>
<ul>
    <li>May use approximations</li>
    <li>Does not guarantee optimal reasoning</li>
    <li>Internal logic may be opaque</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
Thinking rationally and acting rationally
represent two important but distinct views of intelligence.
</p>

<p>
While logical correctness is valuable,
real-world intelligence is best captured
by the ability to act effectively under uncertainty.
</p>

<p>
For this reason,
<strong>acting rationally</strong> has become the dominant framework
in modern Artificial Intelligence.
