        <h2>1. What Is a Rational Agent?</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>rational agent</strong> is an agent that selects actions that maximize its
            expected performance measure, given the information available to it at the time.
            Rationality is the central concept that defines intelligence in modern Artificial
            Intelligence.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
            Rationality is about doing the <em>best possible action</em>, not about being perfect.
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Rationality vs Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
            In AI, intelligence is often equated with rational behavior. An intelligent system is
            not necessarily one that thinks like a human, but one that acts appropriately to
            achieve its goals.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Intelligence is measured by behavior, not internal thought</li>
            <li>Rationality depends on goals and available information</li>
            <li>Different goals imply different rational actions</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Performance Measure</h2>
        <p>
            A rational agent’s behavior is evaluated using a <strong>performance measure</strong>,
            which defines what counts as success.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Examples:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Maximizing safety and minimizing travel time (self-driving car)</li>
                <li>Winning the game (chess agent)</li>
                <li>Maximizing user engagement (recommendation system)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            Rational agents optimize exactly what they are measured on—good or bad.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. What Rationality Depends On</h2>
        <p>
            Whether an agent is rational depends on four factors:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The performance measure</li>
            <li>The agent’s percept sequence</li>
            <li>The agent’s available actions</li>
            <li>The agent’s prior knowledge of the environment</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="highlight">
            Rationality is always defined relative to the agent’s environment and capabilities.
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Rationality vs Omniscience</h2>
        <p>
            A rational agent is <strong>not omniscient</strong>. It does not know the outcome of
            future actions with certainty.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead, it chooses actions that maximize <em>expected</em> performance based on
            probabilities and available evidence.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
            A rational chess agent may still lose due to uncertainty or limited computation.
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Rationality vs Perfection</h2>
        <p>
            Rationality does not mean always achieving the best outcome. It means selecting the
            best action given constraints.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Limited sensing</li>
            <li>Incomplete models</li>
            <li>Time and computational limits</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Agents operating under such constraints are called <strong>bounded rational agents</strong>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Examples of Rational Agents</h2>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Vacuum Cleaner Agent:</strong><br>
            Rational action: Clean when dirt is detected, move when no dirt is present.
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Self-Driving Car:</strong><br>
            Rational action: Slow down in poor visibility even if the road is clear.
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Chatbot:</strong><br>
            Rational action: Generate responses that maximize relevance and user satisfaction.
        </div>

    <section>
        <h2>9. Learning and Rationality</h2>
        <p>
            Learning allows agents to become more rational over time by improving their models of
            the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            A learning agent may behave sub-optimally initially, yet still be rational if it is
            gathering information to improve future performance.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>10. Why Rational Agents Matter</h2>
        <p>
            The concept of rational agents provides a unified foundation for Artificial
            Intelligence. It applies equally to simple rule-based systems and advanced learning
            agents.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
            AI is best understood as the study of rational agents acting in complex environments.
