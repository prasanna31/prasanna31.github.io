        <h2>1. What Is Agent–Environment Interaction?</h2>
        <p>
            In Artificial Intelligence, intelligence is best understood as an ongoing interaction
            between an <strong>agent</strong> and its <strong>environment</strong>. The agent
            perceives the state of the environment, decides what to do, and performs actions that
            affect the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            This interaction does not occur once, but continuously over time, forming a feedback
            loop. The success of an agent depends on how effectively it can sense, decide, and act
            within this loop.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
            Intelligence emerges from interaction, not isolation.
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. The Agent–Environment Loop</h2>
        <p>
            The interaction between an agent and the environment can be described as a repeating
            cycle:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The environment exists in some state</li>
            <li>The agent perceives part of that state through sensors</li>
            <li>The agent selects an action based on its percepts</li>
            <li>The action alters the environment</li>
            <li>The cycle repeats</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Simple Loop:</strong><br>
            Environment → Sensors → Agent → Actuators → Environment
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Role of Sensors</h2>
        <p>
            Sensors are the agent’s interface to the environment. They provide perceptual input
            about the current state of the world.
        </p>

        <h3>Examples of Sensors</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cameras and microphones (robots, self-driving cars)</li>
            <li>Keyboard input and mouse events (software agents)</li>
            <li>Market data feeds (trading agents)</li>
            <li>Text prompts and conversation history (chatbots)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Sensors may provide incomplete, noisy, or delayed information, which significantly
            affects agent behavior.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Role of Actuators</h2>
        <p>
            Actuators allow an agent to act upon the environment. Through actuators, decisions are
            converted into physical or virtual actions.
        </p>

        <h3>Examples of Actuators</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Motors, wheels, robotic arms</li>
            <li>Screen output, API calls</li>
            <li>Network requests or database updates</li>
            <li>Text generation in conversational agents</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The effectiveness of an agent is limited by the capabilities of its actuators.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Percepts and Percept Sequences</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>percept</strong> is the agent’s immediate sensory input at a given time step.
            Over time, the agent accumulates a <strong>percept sequence</strong>, which represents
            its experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Intelligent agents typically base their actions not just on the current percept, but
            on the entire percept history.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
            The same percept may require different actions depending on past experiences.
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Environment Properties</h2>
        <p>
            The nature of the environment strongly influences agent design. Environments are
            classified along several dimensions.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Environment Characteristics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fully observable vs partially observable</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Deterministic vs stochastic</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Episodic vs sequential</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Static vs dynamic</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Discrete vs continuous</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Single-agent vs multi-agent</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Example: Vacuum Cleaner World</h2>
        <div class="example">
            <p>
                In the classic vacuum cleaner environment:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Agent: Vacuum cleaner</li>
                <li>Environment: Rooms with dirt</li>
                <li>Sensors: Dirt sensor, location sensor</li>
                <li>Actuators: Move left, move right, suck</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The agent repeatedly senses dirt and location, decides an action, and updates the
                environment accordingly.
            </p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>8. Why Interaction Matters for Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
            Intelligence cannot be separated from interaction. An agent that never acts cannot
            learn, adapt, or improve. Similarly, an agent that cannot perceive cannot act
            meaningfully.
        </p>
        <p>
            Learning, planning, reasoning, and decision-making all depend on feedback from the
            environment.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>9. Agent–Environment Interaction in Modern AI</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Reinforcement learning agents interacting with simulators</li>
            <li>Autonomous vehicles interacting with traffic environments</li>
            <li>Game-playing agents interacting with game states</li>
            <li>Conversational agents interacting with users</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Modern AI systems are increasingly evaluated based on how well they adapt through
            interaction rather than static prediction.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The agent–environment interaction framework provides a unified way to understand
            Artificial Intelligence. It highlights intelligence as an adaptive, goal-driven
            process rooted in perception and action.

            AI is not just about computation—it is about interaction with the world.
