    <h1>Concept of Intelligent Agents</h1>
    <p>
        The foundational model for understanding artificial intelligence as entities that
        perceive, decide, and act rationally in an environment
    </p>
</header>

<main>

    <section>
        <h2>1. What Is an Intelligent Agent?</h2>
        <p>
            An <strong>intelligent agent</strong> is any entity that perceives its environment
            through sensors and acts upon that environment through actuators in order to achieve
            goals. This definition forms the core of modern Artificial Intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Humans, animals, robots, and software programs can all be modeled as agents. What makes
            an agent <em>intelligent</em> is its ability to make decisions that improve its
            performance over time.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Formal definition:</strong> An intelligent agent perceives its environment,
            reasons about it, and takes actions that maximize a given performance measure.
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Agent–Environment Interaction</h2>
        <p>
            The agent and its environment form a continuous feedback loop. At each step, the agent
            observes the environment, decides what to do, and performs an action that changes the
            environment.
        </p>

        <h3>Core Components</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sensors:</strong> Collect information from the environment</li>
            <li><strong>Actuators:</strong> Execute actions in the environment</li>
            <li><strong>Agent Program:</strong> Maps percepts to actions</li>
            <li><strong>Environment:</strong> The external world the agent operates in</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> A self-driving car uses cameras and lidar as sensors, steering
            and brakes as actuators, and driving policies as its agent program.
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Rational Agents</h2>
        <p>
            Intelligence in AI is closely tied to the concept of <strong>rationality</strong>.
            A rational agent chooses actions that maximize its expected performance given its
            percepts and knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rationality does not imply perfection or omniscience. A rational agent may still make
            mistakes due to incomplete information or uncertainty.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
            Rational behavior is defined relative to goals, percepts, and available actions—not
            absolute correctness.
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Performance Measure</h2>
        <p>
            A performance measure defines how successful an agent is. It is specified by the
            designer and depends on the task environment.
        </p>

        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Winning a game (chess, Go)</li>
            <li>Minimizing fuel consumption</li>
            <li>Maximizing user satisfaction</li>
            <li>Reducing error rate in predictions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Designing the right performance measure is critical, as agents optimize exactly what
            they are rewarded for.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Types of Intelligent Agents</h2>

        <h3>Simple Reflex Agents</h3>
        <p>
            These agents act based solely on the current percept, using condition–action rules.
            They do not maintain internal state.
        </p>

        <h3>Model-Based Agents</h3>
        <p>
            These agents maintain an internal model of the environment to handle partial
            observability.
        </p>

        <h3>Goal-Based Agents</h3>
        <p>
            These agents act to achieve specific goals, requiring planning and search.
        </p>

        <h3>Utility-Based Agents</h3>
        <p>
            These agents use a utility function to measure how desirable a state is, allowing
            trade-offs between competing goals.
        </p>

        <h3>Learning Agents</h3>
        <p>
            Learning agents improve their behavior over time by learning from experience.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Learning Agents: Internal Structure</h2>
        <p>
            A learning agent typically consists of four components:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Performance Element:</strong> Chooses actions</li>
            <li><strong>Learning Element:</strong> Improves the performance element</li>
            <li><strong>Critic:</strong> Evaluates performance</li>
            <li><strong>Problem Generator:</strong> Suggests exploratory actions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This architecture allows agents to adapt to unknown or changing environments.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Task Environments (PEAS Framework)</h2>
        <p>
            Task environments are specified using the PEAS framework:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>P</strong>erformance measure</li>
            <li><strong>E</strong>nvironment</li>
            <li><strong>A</strong>ctuators</li>
            <li><strong>S</strong>ensors</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example (Vacuum Cleaner Agent):</strong><br>
            Performance: Cleanliness, time, energy<br>
            Environment: Rooms, dirt, walls<br>
            Actuators: Move, suck, turn off<br>
            Sensors: Dirt sensor, location sensor
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>8. Why Intelligent Agents Are Central to AI</h2>
        <p>
            The intelligent agent model unifies diverse AI problems—search, planning, learning,
            perception, and reasoning—under a single conceptual framework.
        </p>
        <p>
            Modern AI systems, including chatbots, recommendation engines, robots, and autonomous
            systems, can all be understood as intelligent agents operating in different
            environments.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>9. Limitations of the Agent Model</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Difficulty modeling complex human values</li>
            <li>Challenges in multi-agent coordination</li>
            <li>Computational constraints in real-world environments</li>
            <li>Uncertainty and incomplete information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Despite these challenges, the agent-based perspective remains the most influential
            framework in Artificial Intelligence.
