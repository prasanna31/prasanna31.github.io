        <h2>1. Introduction to Competitive Environments</h2>
        <p>
            In many Artificial Intelligence applications, an agent does not operate alone or in
            cooperation with others. Instead, it must function in the presence of other agents
            whose goals are directly opposed to its own.
        </p>
        <p>
            Such environments are called <strong>competitive environments</strong>. These
            environments introduce strategic reasoning, adversarial thinking, and uncertainty
            due to the presence of opponents.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Definition of Competitive Environments</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>competitive environment</strong> is a type of multi-agent environment in which
            agents have <strong>conflicting or opposing objectives</strong>. The success of one
            agent often implies the failure or reduced performance of another.
        </p>
        <p>
            In competitive environments:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Agents act to maximize their own performance</li>
            <li>Agents’ goals are in direct conflict</li>
            <li>The environment’s dynamics depend on opponents’ actions</li>
            <li>Outcomes are influenced by strategic interactions</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Key Characteristics of Competitive Environments</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Opposing Goals</h3>
        <p>
            Agents pursue goals that cannot all be satisfied simultaneously. One agent’s gain
            often corresponds to another agent’s loss.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Strategic Decision Making</h3>
        <p>
            Agents must reason about the possible actions, intentions, and strategies of opponents.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Non-Stationary Environment</h3>
        <p>
            From the perspective of any single agent, the environment is non-stationary because
            other agents are continuously adapting their behavior.
        </p>

        <h3>3.4 Uncertainty Due to Opponents</h3>
        <p>
            Even if the environment itself is deterministic, uncertainty arises because opponents’
            choices are unknown.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Examples of Competitive Environments</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 1: Chess</h3>
            <p>
                Two agents compete with the goal of checkmating the opponent’s king.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Zero-sum game</li>
                <li>Perfect information</li>
                <li>Highly strategic</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 2: Online Auctions</h3>
            <p>
                Multiple bidders compete to win an item at the lowest possible price.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Conflicting objectives</li>
                <li>Strategic bidding</li>
                <li>Imperfect information</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 3: Robot Soccer (Opposing Teams)</h3>
            <p>
                Two teams of robots compete to score goals against each other.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mixed cooperation and competition</li>
                <li>Dynamic and real-time</li>
                <li>Strategic team behavior</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>5. Competitive vs Cooperative Environments</h2>

        <div class="comparison">
            <p>
                Competitive environments are often contrasted with cooperative environments.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Competitive:</strong> Agents have conflicting goals
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cooperative:</strong> Agents share common objectives
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Competitive:</strong> Requires adversarial reasoning
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cooperative:</strong> Focuses on coordination and communication
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Chess is competitive, while multi-robot object transport is cooperative.

        <h2>6. Implications for Agent Design</h2>
        <p>
            Agents in competitive environments require specialized techniques, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Game theory</li>
            <li>Adversarial search (minimax, alpha-beta pruning)</li>
            <li>Opponent modeling</li>
            <li>Multi-agent reinforcement learning</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Agents must balance optimal play with robustness against unpredictable opponents.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Competitive environments are multi-agent settings where agents have opposing goals.
            These environments introduce strategic complexity, uncertainty, and non-stationarity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding competitive environments is essential for building intelligent systems
            that operate effectively in games, markets, and adversarial real-world scenarios.
