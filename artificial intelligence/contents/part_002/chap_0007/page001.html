    <p>An Important Classification of Task Environments in Artificial Intelligence</p>

        <h2>1. What is an Environment in AI?</h2>
        <p>
            In Artificial Intelligence, an <strong>environment</strong> refers to everything that exists outside
            an intelligent agent and with which the agent interacts. The environment provides percepts (inputs)
            to the agent through sensors and is affected by the agent’s actions through actuators.
        </p>
        <p>
            To design intelligent systems effectively, AI researchers classify environments based on their
            properties. One such important classification is based on whether the agent’s experience can be
            broken into independent episodes. This leads to the concept of <strong>episodic environments</strong>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Definition of Episodic Environments</h2>
        <p>
            An <strong>episodic environment</strong> is an environment in which the agent’s experience is divided
            into a sequence of episodes, and <strong>each episode is independent of all others</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In such environments:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The agent perceives the environment.</li>
            <li>The agent performs a single action.</li>
            <li>The episode ends immediately.</li>
            <li>The next episode starts fresh, unaffected by previous actions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The key idea is that <strong>the agent’s current decision does not affect future states of the environment</strong>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Key Characteristics of Episodic Environments</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Independence of Episodes</h3>
        <p>
            Each episode is self-contained. What the agent does in one episode has no influence on what happens
            in the next episode. There is no long-term dependency.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 No Need for Memory</h3>
        <p>
            Since past episodes do not affect future ones, the agent does not need to remember previous percepts
            or actions. Decisions can be made solely based on the current percept.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Simplified Decision Making</h3>
        <p>
            The agent’s goal is to choose the best action for the current episode only. There is no planning over
            time or concern for delayed consequences.
        </p>

        <h3>3.4 Often Static During an Episode</h3>
        <p>
            In many episodic environments, the environment does not change while the agent is deciding what to do.
            Once the action is taken, the episode ends.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Real-World Examples of Episodic Environments</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 1: Image Classification</h3>
            <p>
                An AI system is given an image and asked to classify it (for example, cat or dog).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each image is a separate episode.</li>
                <li>The classification of one image does not affect the classification of another.</li>
                <li>No memory of previous images is required.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 2: Spam Email Detection</h3>
            <p>
                Each incoming email is evaluated independently to decide whether it is spam or not.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Emails are independent episodes.</li>
                <li>Decisions on earlier emails do not influence future emails.</li>
                <li>The agent only needs the current email’s content.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 3: Quality Inspection System</h3>
            <p>
                A vision-based system checks whether a manufactured part is defective.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each inspection is a separate episode.</li>
                <li>One defective decision does not affect the next inspection.</li>
                <li>No sequential strategy is required.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Comparison with Sequential Environments</h2>

        <div class="comparison">
            <p>
                To better understand episodic environments, it is helpful to compare them with
                <strong>sequential environments</strong>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Episodic Environment:</strong> Current action affects only the current episode.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sequential Environment:</strong> Current action affects future states and rewards.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Episodic:</strong> No planning or long-term strategy needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sequential:</strong> Requires planning, memory, and reasoning over time.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For example, a game of chess is sequential, while classifying images is episodic.
            </p>

        <h2>6. Implications for Agent Design</h2>
        <p>
            Episodic environments greatly simplify the design of intelligent agents. Since the agent does not need
            to consider future consequences, it can use:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple rule-based systems</li>
            <li>Supervised learning models</li>
            <li>Stateless decision functions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This is why many early and successful AI applications—such as pattern recognition and classification—
            naturally fit into episodic environments.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Episodic environments represent one of the simplest types of task environments in Artificial Intelligence.
            They are characterized by independent episodes, lack of long-term consequences, and minimal need for memory
            or planning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding episodic environments is essential because they form the foundation for many real-world AI
            systems and provide a contrast to more complex sequential and stochastic environments.
