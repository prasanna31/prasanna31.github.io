        <h2>1. Introduction to Dynamic Environments</h2>
        <p>
            In many real-world situations, an intelligent agent must operate in an environment that
            changes continuously and independently of the agent’s actions. Such environments introduce
            uncertainty, time pressure, and the need for rapid decision making.
        </p>
        <p>
            These environments are known as <strong>dynamic environments</strong>, and they represent
            some of the most challenging settings for artificial intelligence systems.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Definition of Dynamic Environments</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>dynamic environment</strong> is an environment that can change while the agent
            is deliberating or between actions, even if the agent does nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
            In dynamic environments:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The environment evolves over time.</li>
            <li>Changes may occur independently of the agent.</li>
            <li>Delays in action can lead to outdated decisions.</li>
            <li>Time is a critical factor.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Key Characteristics of Dynamic Environments</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Time Sensitivity</h3>
        <p>
            In dynamic environments, taking too long to decide can result in failure because
            the environment may change before the action is executed.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Continuous Change</h3>
        <p>
            The environment may change continuously due to external processes such as other agents,
            physical laws, or random events.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Uncertainty and Unpredictability</h3>
        <p>
            Changes in the environment are often partially unpredictable, requiring agents
            to operate under uncertainty.
        </p>

        <h3>3.4 Need for Continuous Sensing</h3>
        <p>
            Agents must constantly monitor the environment to maintain an accurate understanding
            of the current state.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Examples of Dynamic Environments</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 1: Autonomous Driving</h3>
            <p>
                Traffic conditions change continuously due to the actions of other vehicles,
                pedestrians, and traffic signals.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Other agents act independently.</li>
                <li>Delays can cause accidents.</li>
                <li>Real-time reactions are essential.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 2: Stock Market Trading</h3>
            <p>
                Market prices fluctuate constantly due to external economic factors
                and actions of other traders.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The environment changes even if the agent is inactive.</li>
                <li>Decisions must be made quickly.</li>
                <li>Outdated information can lead to losses.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 3: Robot Soccer</h3>
            <p>
                Multiple robots and a moving ball create a rapidly changing environment.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>State changes continuously.</li>
                <li>Coordination and fast response are required.</li>
                <li>Opponent actions introduce uncertainty.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>5. Comparison with Static Environments</h2>

        <div class="comparison">
            <p>
                Dynamic environments are the opposite of static environments.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Dynamic:</strong> Environment can change while the agent is thinking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Static:</strong> Environment remains unchanged during deliberation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Dynamic:</strong> Requires real-time decision making.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Static:</strong> Allows unlimited computation time.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Driving a car is dynamic, whereas solving a crossword puzzle is static.
            </p>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Implications for Agent Design</h2>
        <p>
            Agents in dynamic environments must be designed to handle time pressure and uncertainty.
            They often rely on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reactive architectures</li>
            <li>Real-time planning and control</li>
            <li>Continuous sensing and feedback loops</li>
            <li>Reinforcement learning and adaptive strategies</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These agents must balance decision quality with decision speed to operate effectively.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Dynamic environments are characterized by ongoing changes that occur independently
            of the agent’s actions. Time, uncertainty, and rapid response are central challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mastering dynamic environments is essential for building AI systems that can operate
            successfully in real-world, unpredictable scenarios.
