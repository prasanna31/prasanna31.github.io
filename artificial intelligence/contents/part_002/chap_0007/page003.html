        <h2>1. Introduction to Static Environments</h2>
        <p>
            In Artificial Intelligence, the environment in which an agent operates can change in various ways.
            One important classification of environments is based on whether the environment changes while
            the agent is deciding what action to take.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Static environments</strong> are those in which the environment remains unchanged
            while the agent is deliberating. Time does not play a role in the evolution of the environment
            unless the agent itself takes an action.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Definition of Static Environments</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>static environment</strong> is an environment that does not change during the agent’s
            decision-making process. The environment remains fixed until the agent performs an action.
        </p>
        <p>
            In static environments:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The environment does not evolve on its own.</li>
            <li>Time has no direct impact on the environment.</li>
            <li>The agent does not need to act quickly to prevent changes.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Key Characteristics of Static Environments</h2>

        <h3>3.1 No Time Pressure</h3>
        <p>
            Since the environment remains unchanged while the agent is thinking, there is no penalty
            for taking additional time to compute the best action.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Environment Changes Only Due to Agent Actions</h3>
        <p>
            Any change in the environment occurs solely as a result of the agent’s actions, not due
            to external processes.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Simplified Reasoning</h3>
        <p>
            Static environments simplify reasoning and planning because the agent can assume that
            the world will remain the same until it acts.
        </p>

        <h3>3.4 Predictable Perception</h3>
        <p>
            The agent can safely assume that the percept it receives remains valid while deciding
            what to do next.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Examples of Static Environments</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 1: Crossword Puzzle</h3>
            <p>
                A crossword puzzle does not change while a person is thinking about the next word.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The puzzle remains fixed.</li>
                <li>Time does not affect the puzzle.</li>
                <li>Only the solver’s actions fill in answers.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 2: Chess (During a Player’s Turn)</h3>
            <p>
                During a player’s turn, the chessboard remains static until a move is made.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The board does not change while the player thinks.</li>
                <li>No external events alter the game state.</li>
                <li>The next state depends only on the chosen move.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 3: Mathematical Problem Solving</h3>
            <p>
                When solving a math problem, the problem statement does not change over time.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The given information remains fixed.</li>
                <li>The agent can take unlimited reasoning time.</li>
                <li>Only the solution attempt changes the state.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>5. Comparison with Dynamic Environments</h2>

        <div class="comparison">
            <p>
                Static environments are often contrasted with <strong>dynamic environments</strong>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Static:</strong> Environment does not change while the agent is thinking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Dynamic:</strong> Environment may change independently of the agent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Static:</strong> No urgency in decision making.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Dynamic:</strong> Requires real-time responses.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For example, a crossword puzzle is static, whereas driving a car in traffic is dynamic.

        <h2>6. Implications for Agent Design</h2>
        <p>
            Agents operating in static environments can be designed with simpler architectures.
            They often rely on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Search-based problem solving</li>
            <li>Logical reasoning systems</li>
            <li>Offline planning algorithms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Since the environment does not change unexpectedly, the agent does not need continuous sensing
            or rapid reactions.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Static environments are characterized by the absence of change during the agent’s deliberation.
            This property makes them easier to reason about and ideal for classical AI problem-solving techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding static environments provides a foundation for appreciating more complex
            dynamic and real-time environments encountered in real-world AI systems.
