        <h2>1. Introduction to Sequential Environments</h2>
        <p>
            In Artificial Intelligence, an intelligent agent operates within an environment by continuously
            perceiving its state and taking actions. One important way of classifying environments is based on
            whether the agent’s decisions affect only the current situation or also influence future situations.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Sequential environments</strong> represent the class of environments where an agent’s
            current actions have a direct impact on future states, future percepts, and future rewards.
            Decision making in such environments is inherently dependent on time.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Definition of Sequential Environments</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>sequential environment</strong> is an environment in which the agent’s experience is
            extended over a sequence of time steps, and the <strong>current action affects future states
            of the environment</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In these environments:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The environment evolves over time.</li>
            <li>Actions have long-term consequences.</li>
            <li>Future decisions depend on past actions.</li>
            <li>The agent must consider the entire sequence of actions, not just the immediate outcome.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Key Characteristics of Sequential Environments</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Dependency on Past Actions</h3>
        <p>
            Unlike episodic environments, decisions in sequential environments are not independent.
            What the agent does now can significantly alter the set of possibilities available in the future.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Requirement of Memory</h3>
        <p>
            The agent often needs to remember past percepts or maintain an internal state. This memory
            helps the agent reason about how it arrived at the current situation.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Need for Planning</h3>
        <p>
            Sequential environments require planning and foresight. An agent must evaluate not only
            immediate rewards but also delayed rewards that may occur much later.
        </p>

        <h3>3.4 Continuous Interaction</h3>
        <p>
            The agent and the environment interact continuously over time. The environment may change
            even while the agent is deliberating.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Real-World Examples of Sequential Environments</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 1: Chess</h3>
            <p>
                Chess is a classic example of a sequential environment.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each move affects future board positions.</li>
                <li>A poor early move can lead to unavoidable loss later.</li>
                <li>Long-term strategy is essential.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 2: Autonomous Driving</h3>
            <p>
                An autonomous vehicle must continuously make decisions such as accelerating, braking,
                or turning.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each action changes the vehicle’s position and speed.</li>
                <li>Errors accumulate over time.</li>
                <li>Safety depends on long-term planning.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 3: Robot Navigation</h3>
            <p>
                A robot navigating a building must decide a sequence of movements to reach a destination.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wrong turns waste time or cause collisions.</li>
                <li>The path taken affects future options.</li>
                <li>The task cannot be solved in a single step.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>5. Comparison with Episodic Environments</h2>

        <div class="comparison">
            <p>
                Sequential environments are fundamentally different from episodic environments.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sequential:</strong> Current actions influence future states and rewards.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Episodic:</strong> Each decision is independent of previous ones.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sequential:</strong> Requires planning and long-term strategy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Episodic:</strong> Focuses only on immediate performance.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Games, navigation, and control systems are sequential, whereas classification tasks
                are typically episodic.

        <h2>6. Implications for Agent Design</h2>
        <p>
            Designing agents for sequential environments is significantly more complex. Such agents often rely on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>State representations</li>
            <li>Search algorithms (e.g., minimax, A*)</li>
            <li>Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)</li>
            <li>Reinforcement Learning techniques</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These tools allow agents to reason over time, evaluate future outcomes, and optimize long-term performance.

        <h2>7. Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Sequential environments are a fundamental concept in Artificial Intelligence, representing
            scenarios where actions have lasting consequences. They demand memory, planning, and
            strategic reasoning from intelligent agents.
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding sequential environments is essential for building intelligent systems
            capable of operating in dynamic, real-world situations.
