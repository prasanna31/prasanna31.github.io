        <h2>1. Introduction to Discrete Environments</h2>
        <p>
            In Artificial Intelligence, environments can be categorized based on how states,
            actions, perceptions, and time are represented. One important distinction is
            between <strong>discrete</strong> and <strong>continuous</strong> environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Discrete environments</strong> are those in which the agent can perceive
            and act in a world composed of a finite or countably infinite set of distinct states,
            actions, and time steps.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Definition of Discrete Environments</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>discrete environment</strong> is an environment where:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The set of possible states is finite or countably infinite</li>
            <li>The set of possible actions is finite</li>
            <li>Percepts are distinct and well-defined</li>
            <li>Time progresses in discrete steps</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            At each time step, the agent observes the current state, selects an action from
            a predefined set, and transitions to a new state.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Key Characteristics of Discrete Environments</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Countable State Space</h3>
        <p>
            The environment consists of a limited number of distinct states that can be
            explicitly represented and enumerated.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Finite Action Set</h3>
        <p>
            At any point, the agent has a finite set of actions available. Each action leads
            to a clearly defined state transition.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Step-Based Time Progression</h3>
        <p>
            Time advances in discrete steps. The environment changes only at these time steps,
            not continuously.
        </p>

        <h3>3.4 Clear State Transitions</h3>
        <p>
            Transitions between states are clearly defined, often modeled using state
            transition tables or graphs.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Examples of Discrete Environments</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 1: Chess</h3>
            <p>
                Chess is a classic discrete environment.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Finite board positions</li>
                <li>Discrete moves</li>
                <li>Turn-based time steps</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 2: Grid-Based Maze</h3>
            <p>
                An agent navigating a grid maze moves one cell at a time.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Finite number of cells</li>
                <li>Actions: up, down, left, right</li>
                <li>Clear success and failure states</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 3: Board Games</h3>
            <p>
                Games like Tic-Tac-Toe or Checkers operate in discrete environments.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Well-defined states</li>
                <li>Finite action sets</li>
                <li>Turn-based interaction</li>

        <h2>5. Comparison with Continuous Environments</h2>

        <div class="comparison">
            <p>
                Discrete environments are often contrasted with <strong>continuous environments</strong>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Discrete:</strong> Finite or countable states and actions
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Continuous:</strong> Infinite, real-valued states and actions
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Discrete:</strong> Step-by-step time progression
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Continuous:</strong> Time flows continuously
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Chess is discrete, whereas controlling a robotic arm involves continuous environments.

        <h2>6. Implications for Agent Design</h2>
        <p>
            Discrete environments allow the use of classical AI techniques such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*)</li>
            <li>Game tree exploration</li>
            <li>Markov Decision Processes with finite states</li>
            <li>Dynamic programming</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Because the state space is countable, agents can often explicitly represent
            and reason about all possible outcomes.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Discrete environments consist of well-defined, countable states, actions,
            and time steps. They are easier to model and reason about than continuous
            environments and form the foundation of many classical AI problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding discrete environments is essential before moving on to
            continuous and hybrid environments encountered in real-world AI systems.
