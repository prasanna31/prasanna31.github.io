        <h2>1. Introduction to Continuous Environments</h2>
        <p>
            In Artificial Intelligence, not all environments can be described using a finite
            set of states or actions. Many real-world environments involve quantities such as
            time, distance, speed, and force, which vary smoothly over a range of values.
        </p>
        <p>
            Such environments are known as <strong>continuous environments</strong>. They
            represent a more realistic but more complex class of environments compared to
            discrete environments.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Definition of Continuous Environments</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>continuous environment</strong> is an environment in which:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The state space is continuous (often real-valued)</li>
            <li>The action space is continuous</li>
            <li>Percepts may be continuous signals</li>
            <li>Time progresses continuously</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Small changes in actions or time can lead to small changes in the environment’s state.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Key Characteristics of Continuous Environments</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Infinite State Space</h3>
        <p>
            The number of possible states is uncountably infinite. For example, an agent’s
            position in physical space can take infinitely many values.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Real-Valued Actions</h3>
        <p>
            Actions are not limited to a fixed set. Instead, they may be real-valued, such as
            applying a certain amount of force or turning a steering wheel by a specific angle.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Continuous Time</h3>
        <p>
            The environment evolves continuously over time, not in discrete steps.
        </p>

        <h3>3.4 Sensitivity to Small Changes</h3>
        <p>
            Small variations in perception or action can significantly affect future states,
            making control and prediction more challenging.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Examples of Continuous Environments</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 1: Autonomous Vehicle Control</h3>
            <p>
                Steering, acceleration, and braking involve continuous control variables.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Speed varies continuously</li>
                <li>Steering angles are real-valued</li>
                <li>Vehicle dynamics evolve smoothly</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 2: Robotic Arm Manipulation</h3>
            <p>
                A robotic arm must control joint angles and forces with high precision.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Joint positions are continuous</li>
                <li>Force and torque are real-valued</li>
                <li>Small errors can cause failure</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 3: Temperature Control System</h3>
            <p>
                A thermostat controls temperature, which changes continuously over time.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Temperature is a real-valued variable</li>
                <li>System response is gradual</li>
                <li>Feedback control is required</li>

        <h2>5. Comparison with Discrete Environments</h2>

        <div class="comparison">
            <p>
                Continuous environments differ fundamentally from discrete environments.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Continuous:</strong> Infinite, real-valued states and actions
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Discrete:</strong> Finite or countable states and actions
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Continuous:</strong> Time flows smoothly
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Discrete:</strong> Time advances in steps
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Controlling a drone is continuous, whereas playing chess is discrete.

        <h2>6. Implications for Agent Design</h2>
        <p>
            Continuous environments require more advanced techniques, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Control theory</li>
            <li>Continuous Markov Decision Processes</li>
            <li>Function approximation</li>
            <li>Reinforcement learning with continuous action spaces</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Exact solutions are often infeasible, so approximation and learning-based
            methods are commonly used.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Continuous environments involve infinite, smoothly varying states, actions,
            and time. They more accurately model real-world systems but introduce significant
            complexity in perception, control, and decision making.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mastering continuous environments is crucial for building intelligent systems
            that interact with the physical world.
