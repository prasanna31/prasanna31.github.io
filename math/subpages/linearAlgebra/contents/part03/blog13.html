<h1>Exchange Lemma and Why All Bases Have the Same Size</h1>

<p>The Exchange Lemma (also known as the <strong>Steinitz Exchange Lemma</strong>) is a cornerstone of linear algebra. It underpins the idea that the dimension of a vector space is an <strong>invariant</strong>, meaning that all bases of a finite-dimensional vector space contain the same number of vectors. This chapter will explore the lemma in depth, provide detailed proofs, multiple examples, geometric intuition, and exercises to fully internalize the concept.</p>

<h2>1. Motivation and Historical Context</h2>
<p>The question of whether all bases have the same size arises naturally when we consider vector spaces like ℝ² or ℝ³. For example, in ℝ², the standard basis {(1,0),(0,1)} seems “natural,” but other bases like {(1,1),(1,-1)} also exist. Are these fundamentally equivalent? Can we always measure the "size" of a vector space in terms of the number of independent directions? The Exchange Lemma, formulated in the early 20th century by Ernst Steinitz, provides a rigorous foundation to answer these questions.</p>

<p>Intuitively, the lemma formalizes the principle: independent vectors can replace vectors in a spanning set without losing the ability to span the space. This principle directly leads to the invariance of dimension.</p>

<h2>2. Preliminary Concepts</h2>
<p>Before stating the Exchange Lemma, let’s recall key concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linear Independence:</strong> A set S = {v₁, ..., vₘ} is independent if the only solution to a₁v₁ + ... + aₘvₘ = 0 is a₁=...=aₘ=0.</li>
<li><strong>Spanning Set:</strong> A set T spans V if every v ∈ V can be expressed as a linear combination of vectors in T.</li>
<li><strong>Basis:</strong> A set that is both independent and spans the space.</li>
</ul>

<div class="example">
<h3>Example 2.1: ℝ³</h3>
<p>Consider S = {(1,0,0),(0,1,0)} and T = {(1,1,0),(0,1,1),(1,0,1)}. S is independent, T spans ℝ³. The Exchange Lemma tells us that S can replace two vectors in T to form a new spanning set. This illustrates the general principle.</p>
</div>

<h2>3. Statement of the Exchange Lemma</h2>
<p><strong>The Exchange Lemma:</strong> Let S = {v₁, ..., vₘ} be a linearly independent set in a vector space V, and T = {w₁, ..., wₙ} a spanning set. Then:</p>
<ol>
<li>There exists a subset of T of size m that can be replaced by the vectors in S to form a spanning set.</li>
<li>Consequently, m ≤ n.</li>
</ol>

<p>This lemma is fundamental because it quantifies the relationship between independent sets and spanning sets: an independent set can never be larger than a spanning set.</p>

<h2>4. Proof of the Exchange Lemma</h2>
<div class="proof">
<h3>Step-by-Step Proof</h3>
<p>We proceed by induction on the size m of the independent set S.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Base Case (m=1):</strong> Let S = {v₁}. Since T spans V, v₁ can be expressed as a linear combination of vectors in T:
<pre><code>v₁ = a₁w₁ + ... + aₙwₙ, with some aⱼ ≠ 0</code></pre>
Replace wⱼ with v₁. The new set spans V. Hence the lemma holds for m=1.</li>

<li><strong>Inductive Step:</strong> Assume lemma holds for m=k independent vectors. Let S = {v₁, ..., vₖ, vₖ₊₁} be independent.
<ul>
<li>By induction, {v₁, ..., vₖ} can replace k vectors in T to maintain a spanning set T'.</li>
<li>Now consider vₖ₊₁. Since T' spans V, express vₖ₊₁ as a combination of vectors in T':
<pre><code>vₖ₊₁ = b₁u₁ + ... + bₙuₙ, some bⱼ ≠ 0</code></pre>
Replace uⱼ with vₖ₊₁. The set remains spanning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By induction, S can replace m vectors in T to form a spanning set. Therefore m ≤ n.</li>
</ol>
<p>✅ Lemma proved.</p>
</div>

<h2>5. Geometric Intuition</h2>
<p>The Exchange Lemma can be visualized in low dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>In ℝ², if you have two independent vectors forming a “diagonal” and a spanning set forming the standard basis, you can replace one of the standard vectors with a diagonal vector and still cover the plane.</li>
<li>In ℝ³, the principle generalizes: independent vectors define “directions,” and spanning vectors define a “volume.” Replacement preserves the volume while changing coordinates.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Why All Bases Have the Same Size</h2>
<div class="proof">
<h3>Theorem:</h3>
<p>All bases of a finite-dimensional vector space have the same number of vectors.</p>
<ol>
<li>Let B₁ = {v₁, ..., vₘ} and B₂ = {w₁, ..., wₙ} be two bases.</li>
<li>B₁ is independent and B₂ spans V. By the Exchange Lemma, m ≤ n.</li>
<li>B₂ is independent and B₁ spans V. By the Exchange Lemma, n ≤ m.</li>
<li>Thus m = n.</li>
</ol>
<p>✅ This proves that dimension is invariant: the number of vectors in any basis is always the same.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<h3>Example 6.1: ℝ³</h3>
<p>Standard basis: {(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1)} (size 3). Diagonal basis: {(1,1,0),(0,1,1),(1,0,1)} (size 3). Despite different vectors, both bases have 3 vectors. Exchange Lemma guarantees this consistency.</p>
</div>

<h2>7. Applications</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dimension Counting:</strong> Any independent set cannot exceed the dimension; any spanning set has at least the dimension of vectors.</li>
<li><strong>Extending Independent Sets:</strong> Any independent set can be extended to a basis using the Exchange Lemma.</li>
<li><strong>Rank of Matrices:</strong> Column rank = row rank; the lemma ensures consistency of counting independent columns/rows.</li>
<li><strong>Subspace Analysis:</strong> Helps derive the dimension formula: dim(U + W) = dim(U) + dim(W) - dim(U ∩ W).</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>Apply the Exchange Lemma to S = {(1,0,0),(0,1,0)} and T = {(1,1,0),(0,1,1),(1,0,1)} in ℝ³. Replace elements of T to form a new spanning set.</li>
<li>Prove that any independent set in a finite-dimensional space can be extended to a basis.</li>
<li>Verify with an explicit example that all bases of ℝ² have 2 vectors.</li>
<li>Consider a 4-dimensional vector space. Can an independent set have 5 vectors? Justify using the Exchange Lemma.</li>
<li>Given U,W ⊆ ℝ⁴ with dim(U)=2, dim(W)=3, and dim(U∩W)=1, use the lemma to confirm dim(U+W)=4.</li>
</ol>

<h2>9. Summary</h2>
<p>The Exchange Lemma formalizes the interplay between independent and spanning sets in vector spaces. It rigorously proves that all bases have the same size, explaining why dimension is invariant. Beyond finite-dimensional spaces, the principle underlies matrix rank, subspace decomposition, and extension of independent sets to bases. Understanding this lemma is crucial for any deep study of linear algebra.</p>
