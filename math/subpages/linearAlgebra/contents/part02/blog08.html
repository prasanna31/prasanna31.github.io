  <h1>Subspaces and the Geometry of Containment</h1>
  <p>Understanding How Vector Spaces Nest and Interact</p>
</header>

<section>

<h2>1. Why Subspaces Matter</h2>

<p>
A vector space can be huge and abstract, like <code>ℝⁿ</code> or the space
of all continuous functions. Subspaces allow us to focus on meaningful
“sub-universes” where all the vector space structure remains intact.
</p>

<blockquote>
A subspace is a self-contained linear world living inside a larger universe.
</blockquote>

<p>
Every concept in linear algebra — span, linear independence, basis, dimension — is easier to understand by first seeing how subspaces interact.
</p>

---

<h2>2. Definition of a Subspace</h2>

<p>
A subset <code>W</code> of a vector space <code>V</code> is a subspace if:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Zero vector:</strong> <code>0 ∈ W</code></li>
  <li><strong>Closed under addition:</strong> <code>u + v ∈ W</code> for all <code>u,v ∈ W</code></li>
  <li><strong>Closed under scalar multiplication:</strong> <code>a·v ∈ W</code> for all <code>v ∈ W</code> and scalars <code>a</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
Notice how this mirrors the axioms of a vector space — a subspace is essentially a vector space in its own right, but living inside another space.
</p>

---

<h2>3. Geometric Intuition in ℝ² and ℝ³</h2>

<h3>3.1 Lines Through the Origin</h3>

<p>
Every line in <code>ℝ²</code> that passes through the origin is a subspace. Why?  
- Zero vector: line passes through the origin  
- Closure under addition: sum of two vectors on the line is still on the line  
- Closure under scalar multiplication: stretching or reversing a vector keeps it on the line
</p>

<p>
This shows the connection between **algebraic axioms and geometric containment**.
</p>

<h3>3.2 Planes Through the Origin</h3>

<p>
Similarly, any plane in <code>ℝ³</code> passing through the origin is a subspace.  
Lines are 1D subspaces, planes are 2D subspaces.  
Dimension naturally emerges as a measure of “size” inside the bigger space.
</p>

<h3>3.3 Trivial Subspace</h3>

<p>
The set {0} is a subspace of every vector space. It is “tiny” but still respects all axioms.  
This demonstrates that subspaces range from minimal to maximal.
</p>

---

<h2>4. Examples in Function Spaces</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Continuous functions: all polynomials of degree ≤ n form a subspace.</li>
  <li>Even functions: set of all f(x) with f(-x) = f(x) is a subspace.</li>
  <li>Zero function is always included.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The principle is the same: ensure closure under addition and scaling.
</p>

---

<h2>5. Subspace Criteria — How to Check</h2>

<p>Given a subset W of V, verify systematically:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Zero vector is in W</li>
  <li>For all u,v ∈ W, check u+v ∈ W</li>
  <li>For all v ∈ W and scalar a, check a·v ∈ W</li>
</ol>

<p>
If any condition fails, W is not a subspace.
</p>

<h2>6. Non-Examples — When Containment Fails</h2>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Subset</th>
<th>Why It Fails</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Line in ℝ² not through origin</td>
<td>Zero vector not included → violates subspace axiom</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Set of all vectors in ℝ³ with positive components only</td>
<td>Not closed under additive inverses → fails</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Polynomials of degree exactly n</td>
<td>Addition can produce lower degree → not closed under addition</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Functions f with f(0) = 1</td>
<td>Zero function not included → violates subspace axiom</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
These counterexamples reinforce that **every subspace must be fully “stable” under linear operations**.
</p>

<h2>7. Intersections and Containment Hierarchy</h2>

<p>
- Intersection of two subspaces is always a subspace.  
- Union of subspaces is generally <em>not</em> a subspace unless one is contained in the other.
</p>

<blockquote>
Subspaces naturally form a hierarchy — “nested universes” inside the bigger vector space.
</blockquote>

<p>
Example in ℝ³:  
- Line L₁ ⊂ Plane P ⊂ ℝ³.  
- L₁ + L₂ = smallest subspace containing both lines.
</p>

---

<h2>8. Span: Building Subspaces from Vectors</h2>

<p>
Given any set of vectors {v₁,...,vₖ} in V, their <code>span</code> is the smallest subspace containing all of them:  
</p>
<blockquote>
span{v₁,...,vₖ} = {a₁v₁ + ... + aₖvₖ | aᵢ ∈ F}
</blockquote>

<p>
This is where the geometric idea of “containment” meets linear algebra: any subspace can be constructed as the span of a set of vectors.
</p>

---

<h2>9. Geometric Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Subspaces are “self-contained” linear worlds.</li>
  <li>Dimension measures the degrees of freedom in a subspace.</li>
  <li>Lines, planes, and higher-dimensional analogues are all subspaces.</li>
  <li>Intersections, spans, and sums create a rich hierarchy of containment.</li>
</ul>

---

<h2>10. Why This Matters</h2>

<p>
Understanding subspaces is critical because:  
- Solutions of linear equations form subspaces (the kernel)  
- Column spaces of matrices are subspaces  
- Orthogonal projections are always onto subspaces  

Geometry and algebra merge: subspaces are the **shape of linear algebra inside a vector space**.

Mastering subspaces is mastering the geometry of linear algebra.
