  <h1>Examples and Non-Examples of Vector Spaces</h1>
  <p>Deep Exploration of Structure Through What Works and What Fails</p>
</header>

<section>

<h2>1. Why Examples and Non-Examples Are Crucial</h2>

<p>
The abstract definition of a vector space is precise, but it can feel
intimidating. Only by examining examples and counterexamples
do we develop the intuition to recognize vector spaces in the wild.
</p>

<p>
Examples reveal how the axioms interact naturally. Non-examples
show exactly which axioms are violated, sharpening our understanding
and preventing assumptions that “most sets of objects behave like vectors.”
</p>

<blockquote>
Seeing both the successes and failures of the axioms trains your
mathematical instinct more than any amount of mechanical computation.
</blockquote>

<h2>2. Classic Examples of Vector Spaces — Explained</h2>

<h3>2.1 Euclidean Spaces ℝⁿ</h3>

<p>
The set of all n-tuples of real numbers, <code>ℝⁿ</code>, is the archetype
of a vector space. Addition and scalar multiplication are defined
componentwise:
</p>

<blockquote>
(u₁,...,uₙ) + (v₁,...,vₙ) = (u₁+v₁,...,uₙ+vₙ),  
a·(v₁,...,vₙ) = (a·v₁,...,a·vₙ)
</blockquote>

<p>
Why it works:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Closure:</strong> Adding or scaling numbers keeps you in ℝⁿ.</li>
  <li><strong>Associativity & Commutativity:</strong> Follows from real numbers.</li>
  <li><strong>Zero vector:</strong> (0,...,0) acts as identity.</li>
  <li><strong>Inverses:</strong> Negating each component satisfies the additive inverse requirement.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Takeaway: Euclidean spaces are where geometry and algebra meet,
showing how abstract axioms manifest as familiar objects.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Polynomial Spaces Pₙ</h3>

<p>
Consider polynomials of degree ≤ n with real coefficients:
<code>Pₙ = {a₀ + a₁x + ... + aₙxⁿ | aᵢ ∈ ℝ}</code>
</p>

<p>Why this works:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Addition:</strong> Sum of two degree ≤ n polynomials remains degree ≤ n.</li>
  <li><strong>Scalar multiplication:</strong> Multiplying a polynomial by a scalar preserves degree.</li>
  <li><strong>Zero polynomial:</strong> Acts as additive identity.</li>
  <li>All other axioms follow from real numbers and the definitions of addition and multiplication.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Observation: Pₙ is finite-dimensional; its basis is {1, x, x²,..., xⁿ}.
</p>

---

<h3>2.3 Function Spaces</h3>

<p>
Let <code>F = {f: ℝ → ℝ}</code> be all real-valued functions.  
Pointwise addition and scalar multiplication:
</p>
<blockquote>
(f+g)(x) = f(x)+g(x), a·f(x) = a·f(x)
</blockquote>

<p>Why this works:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Closure: sum or scalar multiple of functions is still a function.</li>
  <li>Zero function: f(x)=0 satisfies additive identity.</li>
  <li>Distributivity: scalar addition and vector addition work pointwise.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Subspaces include continuous functions, differentiable functions,
and integrable functions. This shows how vector spaces exist even
in infinite dimensions.
</p>

---

<h3>2.4 Matrices Mₘₓₙ(ℝ)</h3>

<p>
All m×n matrices with real entries form a vector space under
elementwise addition and scalar multiplication.  
The zero matrix acts as additive identity, and additive inverses exist elementwise.
</p>

---

<h2>3. Non-Examples — Understanding Failures</h2>

<p>
Examining non-examples shows which axioms are fragile and why
vector spaces are constrained.
</p>

<h3>3.1 Positive Reals ℝ⁺</h3>
<p>
<code>ℝ⁺</code> under normal addition fails because additive inverses
do not exist (no negative numbers allowed).  
Even though addition and scalar multiplication by positive numbers work,
this violates the existence of additive inverses.
</p>

<h3>3.2 Polynomials of Degree Exactly n</h3>
<p>
Adding two degree n polynomials can yield a polynomial of lower degree.
Thus, closure under addition fails.  
This shows that “exact” restrictions often violate axioms subtly.
</p>

<h3>3.3 Functions f with f(0)=1</h3>
<p>
Zero function f(x)=0 does not satisfy f(0)=1.  
Additive identity fails; closure may hold but the structure is incomplete.
</p>

<h3>3.4 Integers ℤ over ℝ</h3>
<p>
ℤ is closed under integer addition and subtraction, but not under
scalar multiplication by arbitrary real numbers.  
Hence, ℤ over ℝ is <em>not</em> a vector space.  
This highlights the importance of the field matching the scaling operation.
</p>

<h3>3.5 Vectors with Cross Product as Multiplication</h3>
<p>
If one tried to define “scalar multiplication” using the vector cross product,
distributivity fails and scalar algebra becomes meaningless.  
This illustrates that both operations (addition and scalar multiplication) must align with the axioms.
</p>

<h2>4. Infinite-Dimensional Examples</h2>

<p>
Function spaces and sequence spaces are infinite-dimensional.
Axioms remain valid, but dimensions are no longer countable.  
This emphasizes that the **definition applies equally to finite and infinite universes**.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sequences a₁,a₂,... with real entries</li>
  <li>Continuous functions on [0,1]</li>
  <li>Square-integrable functions L²[0,1]</li>
</ul>

---

<h2>5. Subspaces — Mini Vector Spaces</h2>

<p>
Subsets that themselves satisfy all axioms are called subspaces.  
Checking subspaces enforces three key properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contain the zero vector</li>
  <li>Closed under addition</li>
  <li>Closed under scalar multiplication</li>
</ul>

<p>
Examples: lines through origin in ℝ², planes through origin in ℝ³,
even functions in the space of all functions.
</p>

---

<h2>6. How to Analyze New Candidates</h2>

<p>
When presented with a new set and operations, ask systematically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is addition closed?</li>
  <li>Is scalar multiplication closed?</li>
  <li>Does zero exist?</li>
  <li>Do additive inverses exist?</li>
  <li>Do distributive and associative laws hold?</li>
</ul>

<p>
This step-by-step approach trains your mind to recognize vector spaces
even in unconventional contexts.
</p>

---

<h2>7. Takeaway</h2>

<blockquote>
Vector spaces exist wherever addition and scaling coexist coherently.  
Examples reveal the axioms in action; non-examples show which
axioms are indispensable.  
Learning both builds the intuition to recognize and construct vector spaces everywhere.
