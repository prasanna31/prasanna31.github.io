  <h1>What Makes a Proof a Proof?</h1>
  <p>Why Mathematics Demands Necessity, Not Persuasion</p>
</header>

<section>

<h2>1. The Question Everyone Thinks They Understand</h2>

<p>
Students often believe they know what a proof is.
They have seen proofs.
They have written things called proofs.
They have received marks for proofs.
</p>

<p>
Yet very few can answer the question:
</p>

<blockquote>
What distinguishes a proof from a convincing argument?
</blockquote>

<p>
This chapter exists because the difference is not obvious —
and misunderstanding it prevents genuine mathematical thinking.
</p>

<p>
A proof is not:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A long calculation</li>
  <li>A sequence of algebraic steps</li>
  <li>An example that always seems to work</li>
  <li>An intuitive explanation</li>
</ul>

<p>
Those things may accompany a proof.
They may motivate it.
They may illuminate it.
</p>

<p>
But they are not what makes it a proof.
</p>

---

<h2>2. Mathematics Is Not an Empirical Science</h2>

<p>
In empirical sciences, truth is established by observation.
</p>

<p>
You observe many cases.
You detect patterns.
You generalize.
</p>

<p>
Mathematics does not work this way.
</p>

<blockquote>
No number of examples can prove a mathematical statement.
</blockquote>

<p>
You may check a property for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>100 numbers</li>
  <li>1 million numbers</li>
  <li>Every number a computer can test</li>
</ul>

<p>
And still have proven nothing.
</p>

<p>
Mathematics demands certainty that does not depend on experience.
</p>

---

<h2>3. The Meaning of Mathematical Truth</h2>

<p>
A mathematical statement is not “true” because it works.
</p>

<p>
It is true because:
</p>

<blockquote>
It must be true in every logically possible situation where the assumptions hold.
</blockquote>

<p>
This notion of necessity is the heart of proof.
</p>

<p>
A proof shows that denying the conclusion while accepting the assumptions
leads to contradiction.
</p>

<p>
Nothing weaker is acceptable.
</p>

---

<h2>4. Proof as a Chain of Necessity</h2>

<p>
A proof is a finite sequence of statements such that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each statement follows inevitably from previous ones</li>
  <li>Each step relies only on accepted axioms or earlier results</li>
  <li>No appeal is made to intuition, diagrams, or authority</li>
</ul>

<p>
This does not mean proofs are mechanical.
</p>

<p>
It means they are <em>logically compelled</em>.
</p>

<blockquote>
A proof leaves no freedom for the conclusion to be false.
</blockquote>

---

<h2>5. Assumptions Are Sacred</h2>

<p>
Every proof begins with assumptions.
</p>

<p>
These may be:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Axioms</li>
  <li>Definitions</li>
  <li>Previously proven theorems</li>
</ul>

<p>
A proof never hides assumptions.
</p>

<p>
Changing assumptions changes the universe.
</p>

<p>
A statement may be true in one system and false in another —
and both can be mathematically correct.
</p>

<blockquote>
A proof is conditional truth made explicit.
</blockquote>

---

<h2>6. Why Definitions Matter More Than Results</h2>

<p>
Definitions are not explanations.
</p>

<p>
They are rules of the game.
</p>

<p>
Once a definition is accepted, its consequences are no longer optional.
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The definition of a vector space forces linearity</li>
  <li>The definition of continuity forces limits</li>
  <li>The definition of a group forces inverses</li>
</ul>

<p>
A proof often consists of nothing more than:
</p>

<blockquote>
Unpacking definitions with absolute honesty.
</blockquote>

<p>
This is why weak definitions lead to confusion.
</p>

---

<h2>7. Proof vs Explanation</h2>

<p>
Explanation and proof are not the same.
</p>

<p>
An explanation:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Aims to build intuition</li>
  <li>Uses metaphors</li>
  <li>Appeals to geometry or examples</li>
</ul>

<p>
A proof:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Aims to eliminate doubt</li>
  <li>Uses logic</li>
  <li>Appeals only to necessity</li>
</ul>

<p>
A good mathematician values both —
but never confuses them.
</p>

---

<h2>8. Why Computation Is Not Proof</h2>

<p>
A computation produces an outcome.
</p>

<p>
A proof produces inevitability.
</p>

<p>
Even a perfectly correct calculation proves nothing unless:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>All cases are covered</li>
  <li>No hidden assumptions exist</li>
  <li>The reasoning generalizes</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is why numerical verification is powerless in mathematics.
</p>

---

<h2>9. The Role of Counterexamples</h2>

<p>
A single counterexample destroys a universal claim.
</p>

<p>
This asymmetry is essential.
</p>

<p>
Proof is fragile.
</p>

<p>
If one case escapes your logic,
your proof does not exist.
</p>

<blockquote>
Mathematics does not tolerate “almost always.”
</blockquote>

---

<h2>10. Proof Is About Universality</h2>

<p>
A proof does not speak about one object.
</p>

<p>
It speaks about all objects satisfying the assumptions.
</p>

<p>
When you prove something about vector spaces,
you prove it for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Every dimension</li>
  <li>Every field</li>
  <li>Every basis</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is why proofs feel abstract —
they deliberately ignore irrelevant details.
</p>

---

<h2>11. Proof Techniques Are Secondary</h2>

<p>
Induction, contradiction, contrapositive —
these are techniques, not the essence.
</p>

<p>
The essence is logical inevitability.
</p>

<p>
Techniques are tools for achieving it.
</p>

<blockquote>
Learning proof techniques without understanding proof
is like learning syntax without meaning.
</blockquote>

---

<h2>12. Why Proofs Feel Difficult at First</h2>

<p>
Proofs demand:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Precision of language</li>
  <li>Explicit assumptions</li>
  <li>Zero tolerance for ambiguity</li>
</ul>

<p>
Human intuition evolved for survival, not necessity.
</p>

<p>
Proof requires discipline against intuition.
</p>

---

<h2>13. Proof as Compression of Truth</h2>

<p>
A proof is an extreme form of compression.
</p>

<p>
It replaces infinitely many cases with one argument.
</p>

<p>
This is why proofs are powerful.
</p>

<p>
They scale without computation.
</p>

---

<h2>14. The Ethical Standard of Mathematics</h2>

<p>
A proof is a public object.
</p>

<p>
It must convince any competent reader,
not just its author.
</p>

<p>
This makes mathematics unusually ethical:
</p>

<blockquote>
Authority, reputation, and confidence are irrelevant.
Only logic matters.
</blockquote>

---

<h2>15. Final Reflection</h2>

<blockquote>
A proof does not persuade.
It compels.
</blockquote>

<p>
When you accept a proof,
you are not agreeing with an argument —
you are acknowledging inevitability.
</p>

<p>
This is why mathematics is unique among human disciplines.
</p>

<p>
The next chapter becomes unavoidable:
