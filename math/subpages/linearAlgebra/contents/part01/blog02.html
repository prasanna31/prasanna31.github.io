  <h1>Sets, Functions, and Mathematical Objects</h1>
  <p>The Language in Which All of Mathematics Thinks</p>
</header>

<section>

<h2>1. Why Mathematics Begins Here</h2>

<p>
Every mathematical theory — linear algebra, calculus, probability,
topology, category theory — rests on a silent foundation.
That foundation is not numbers.
It is not equations.
It is not geometry.
</p>

<blockquote>
It is the idea of objects, collections of objects, and relationships between objects.
</blockquote>

<p>
Before we can speak of vectors, we must know what an object is.
Before we can speak of transformations, we must know what a function is.
Before we can speak of structure, we must know what it means to group things together.
</p>

<p>
This is why serious mathematics always begins with:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sets</li>
  <li>Functions</li>
  <li>Abstract objects</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is not pedantry.
This is epistemology.
</p>

---

<h2>2. Sets: The Act of Mathematical Attention</h2>

<p>
A set is often defined as:
</p>

<blockquote>
A collection of distinct objects.
</blockquote>

<p>
This definition is correct but shallow.
</p>

<p>
A deeper truth is:
</p>

<blockquote>
A set is the result of deciding what matters and what does not.
</blockquote>

<p>
When you form a set, you perform an act of abstraction.
You ignore internal details and focus only on membership.
</p>

<p>
In this sense, a set is not a physical thing.
It is a <strong>mental boundary</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Examples:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The set of real numbers ignores how numbers are written</li>
  <li>The set of vectors ignores coordinate representation</li>
  <li>The set of solutions ignores how they were found</li>
</ul>

<p>
Set theory is the mathematics of *classification*.
</p>

---

<h2>3. Membership: The Most Primitive Relation</h2>

<p>
The most fundamental symbol in mathematics is not <code>+</code> or <code>=</code>.
It is:
</p>

<blockquote>
∈ (belongs to)
</blockquote>

<p>
To say <code>x ∈ A</code> is to assert a fact about reality —
that an object falls within a chosen boundary.
</p>

<p>
Everything else is built on this relation.
</p>

<p>
Even equality is secondary.
</p>

<blockquote>
Two objects are equal if they belong to the same sets in the same ways.
</blockquote>

<p>
This is known as the principle of extensionality.
</p>

---

<h2>4. Subsets: Containment of Meaning</h2>

<p>
A subset is not merely a smaller set.
It is a <em>refinement of attention</em>.
</p>

<p>
When we say:
</p>

<blockquote>
A ⊆ B
</blockquote>

<p>
we are saying:
</p>

<blockquote>
Everything meaningful in A is already meaningful in B.
</blockquote>

<p>
In linear algebra, subspaces are subsets with extra structure.
In probability, events are subsets.
In logic, propositions correspond to subsets of possible worlds.
</p>

<p>
Subset relations encode implication, restriction, and specialization.
</p>

---

<h2>5. Mathematical Objects: What Actually Exists?</h2>

<p>
A mathematical object is not a physical object.
It has no mass.
No location.
No color.
</p>

<p>
A mathematical object exists by <strong>definition</strong>.
</p>

<blockquote>
To define is to create.
</blockquote>

<p>
Examples of mathematical objects:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Numbers</li>
  <li>Functions</li>
  <li>Vectors</li>
  <li>Graphs</li>
  <li>Groups</li>
  <li>Spaces</li>
</ul>

<p>
Mathematics is not discovered in nature.
It is <em>constructed</em> and then tested for consistency.
</p>

<p>
Once defined, objects obey rules — not opinions.
</p>

---

<h2>6. Functions: The Central Concept of Modern Mathematics</h2>

<p>
If sets describe <em>what exists</em>,
functions describe <em>how things relate</em>.
</p>

<p>
A function is not a formula.
It is not an expression.
</p>

<blockquote>
A function is a rule that assigns exactly one output to each input.
</blockquote>

<p>
This assignment is the essence.
</p>

<p>
The function exists independently of how it is written.
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A lookup table is a function</li>
  <li>A neural network is a function</li>
  <li>A differential equation defines a function</li>
</ul>

<p>
Modern mathematics is function-centric.
Objects are understood by how they transform under functions.
</p>

---

<h2>7. Domain, Codomain, and the Importance of Typing</h2>

<p>
Every function has:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A domain (where inputs come from)</li>
  <li>A codomain (where outputs live)</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is not bookkeeping.
This is logic.
</p>

<p>
The same rule with different domains is a different function.
</p>

<blockquote>
Functions are typed objects.
</blockquote>

<p>
Linear transformations are functions between vector spaces.
Probability kernels are functions between measurable spaces.
</p>

<p>
Ignoring domains leads to conceptual errors.
</p>

---

<h2>8. Images, Preimages, and Information Flow</h2>

<p>
Functions move information.
</p>

<p>
The image of a set tells you what survives the transformation.
The preimage tells you what causes an outcome.
</p>

<p>
In linear algebra:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Image → column space</li>
  <li>Preimage → solution set</li>
</ul>

<p>
In ML:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Forward pass → image</li>
  <li>Backprop → preimage sensitivity</li>
</ul>

<p>
Understanding functions is understanding causality.
</p>

---

<h2>9. Equality vs Isomorphism: A Mathematical Awakening</h2>

<p>
Beginners ask:
</p>

<blockquote>
“Are these two things equal?”
</blockquote>

<p>
Mathematicians ask:
</p>

<blockquote>
“Are these two things the same in structure?”
</blockquote>

<p>
Isomorphism is the idea that structure matters more than labels.
</p>

<p>
Two sets may be different,
but if there exists a structure-preserving bijection,
they are mathematically identical.
</p>

<blockquote>
Mathematics studies structure up to isomorphism.
</blockquote>

<p>
This idea prepares the mind for linear algebra,
where bases change but spaces remain.
</p>

---

<h2>10. Why This Matters for Linear Algebra</h2>

<p>
Linear algebra is impossible without this foundation.
</p>

<p>
A vector space is a set with extra operations.
A linear map is a function with extra constraints.
A basis is a special subset.
</p>

<p>
Without sets, vectors are meaningless.
Without functions, transformations do not exist.
Without abstraction, structure cannot be seen.
</p>

---

<h2>11. The Mathematical Mindset You Are Building</h2>

<p>
After internalizing this chapter, you should:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Separate objects from representations</li>
  <li>Respect domains and codomains</li>
  <li>Think in terms of mappings, not formulas</li>
  <li>Value structure over symbols</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is the mindset of:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pure mathematicians</li>
  <li>Theoretical physicists</li>
  <li>ML theorists</li>
  <li>Proof engineers</li>
</ul>

---

<h2>12. Closing Reflection</h2>

<blockquote>
Sets teach you what exists.
Functions teach you how things relate.
Mathematical objects teach you how abstraction creates truth.
</blockquote>

<p>
Once this foundation is solid,
linear algebra becomes inevitable — not difficult.
</p>

<p>
You are no longer learning techniques.
You are learning a way of seeing.
