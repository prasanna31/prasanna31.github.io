          <h2>Chapter 1 — Everyday Probability (1–10)</h2>
          <div class="topic"><span class="number">1.</span><strong>What is probability?</strong> — It's a way to say how likely something will happen, like a friendly guess with math.</div>
          <div class="topic"><span class="number">2.</span><strong>Certain & Impossible</strong> — "Certain" means it will happen for sure; "impossible" means it won't happen at all.</div>
